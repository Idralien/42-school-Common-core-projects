# Overview of 42 Projects

### Libft

This is a project where you start by making your own library of functions that you will use in future projects. There were some restrictions on how we were allowed to make the functions but after this we were allowed to change these files and functions to how we wanted it.

### Printf

You had to remake the printf function. The only restrictions we had is that we only had to remake certain specifiers, not the whole of the printf function.

### Get_next_line

A project where we made a function to use in later projects to read from files and retunr the outputs into a string.

### Born2Beroot

A Virtual machine project where we had to setup a server in Debian. We got to learn about security and basic stuff like sudo.

### Push_swap

In this project you have to make a sorting algorithm that is only allowed to sort integers in a as few moves as possible. Very optimise heavy project.

### Minitalk

A project where you setup a client and server through terminal. You have to be able to send any string from the server side and it should print it perfectly back to the client.

### Fdf

You had to make a 3D map wireframe viewer. You already get files with maps in and you have to be able to read them and make a graphical program for them. The graphical part is handled by MinilibX.

### Philosophers

The Dining philosophers project. A project where you get to know about threads and a project that really makes you think about optimising. Also the use of deadlocks were very important because of the restrictions we got.

### Minishell

a lightweight, Unix-like shell implementation in C! This project is a fun dive into the world of command-line interfaces and operating system concepts.

### Netpractice

A very small project that makes you learn about networking and the use of IP addressing and putting masks.

### CUB3D

A Wolvenstein/Doom like game, coded in C using the MiniLibX library. The reason for this project was learning Raycasting.

### CPP Modules 0-4

The start of object oriented programming. Classes and inheritance is very useful.

### IRC

 IRC is a project where you make an irc server that has the ability to be connected to through nc or an irc client.
